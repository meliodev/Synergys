TO DO:
+ PROCESS: Add verification actions in case user starts project from a phase depending on docs/tasks created on previous phase (exp: Devis, RD2), or like DOSSIER ACTION LOGEMENT which skips rd2 & rdn
+ PROCESS: Handle action loadings to avoid press before configure action (and preferably set check animation)
+ PROCESS: Complete process
+ PROCESS: Add responsible for each action
+ PROCESS: Notifications & Emails


+ PROCESS & CREATETASK: Unicity of docType verification: (We suppose, according to the process model, that each task/document type is unic per project. Example: A project has only one Installation/one quote)
-> OPTION 1: Verify if a task with same type already exists for the selected project (to avoid duplicates)
-> OPTION 2 (SELECTED) "TRAVAIL A LA CHAINE: CREER UNE TACHE PAR LA BONNE PERSONNE AU BON MOMENT": Make task types list dynamic: User can create a task only through process action link, and only if he is one of the responsibles. 
+ Commercial task types = [RD1, RDN, VTP, VT] tag: com
+ Poseur task types = [Installation, Rattrapage, Panne, Entretien] tag: tech
+ Add dynamiclly task types..
+ Display 30% phase > step 
+ Reactiver notifications app.js
+ UPdate all user/client objects through collections on update name.. (cloud function trigger)

+ Action a faire
+ add infoCircle 
+ Remove check and do animation 
+ ModalOptions green header, white text
+ Toute la journée
+ pop up instruction when opening task swipable


+ ISSUE: Avoid duplicates of tasks/documents in "multi-users case" (especially if user is not up to date while offline)
-> Solution: Assign the action to one and only one responsible at a time.. To make sure there will be not many users doing the same action. Indeed, it is possible that a user is not up to date while offline, so he can create a task/document that another user has created.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ CREATETASK: Add property 'toute la journée' to task: when we give heure début et fin: 
+ Adjust navigation (Try put all screens same stack or think about a better solution)
+ USERS: onDeleteUser handler: remove user account (on delete user)& keep db document to be able to restore later on.. (links to their profile should handle empty userId or keep their documents to show off their data even if they are deleted..)
+ DESIGN: address description first line is hidden sometimes when there is 2lines
+ (Not anymore: Add tasks timeslots verification on check submit show popup with tasks conflicts)
+ PROCESS: Store process on firestore and handle it as done with permissions (redux cach)

? Can a task be deleted or should it be just archived

DONE:
+ BREAKING PROCESS CHANGE: Change nextStep/nextPhase from step attributes to action attributes.
+ CONDITIONAL FACTURE CHOICE: check if generated quote exist -> choose conversion or manual
+ PROCESS: Add action loading on navigating back
+ PROCESS & CREATETASK: Verify if dueDate > startDate
+ OFFLINE: Disable edit mode when offline (show pop up onsubmit)  
+ PROCESS: Update project step/status attributes all along the process evolution.
+ IMPORTANT PROCESS: Query verification Document upload (add where('attachment.downloadURL', '!=', '') && Route navigation depending on doc exist or not -> if exist we can see attachment still uploading..)
+ PROCESS & UPLOADOCUMENT: Handle waiting/or not during upload document if coming from action link
-> OPTION1 (SELECTED): Wait (user can go back but action is still not verified until attachment is fully uploaded)
-> OPTION2: Go back (if user press action he'll find the attachment still uploading)
+ PROCESS & UPLOADOCUMENT: Remove not available doc types from generate choices



- DASHBOARD (NEW): notifications récentes non lu (7) + voir toutes les notifications / Aucune notification récente if nothing
- DASHBOARD (NEW): From today to next days: red tasks, green for others

# DESIGN: ListDocuments XD design
# DESIGN: favicon
# DESIGN: splashscreen (design pending..)
# DESIGN: Check phone screenshots
# OPTIMIZE: Change filter from menu to modal

+ GLOBAL: Notifications + Emails
+ GLOBAL: "Entité" "Nom de l'entité" action (email title)
+ GLOBAL: Change Notification collection (decompose body: intervenant, action, entity) + Filter (adjust cloud function)
+ GLOBAL: Fetch all collections on app start (offline support)
+ GLOBAL: enable SMS verify


- 1. A la creation, createdBy is a collaborator.
- 2. Add 2 Contacts as attribute of project: 
* Contact commercial {nom, prenom, role, email, telephone}
* Contact technique {nom, prenom, role, email, telephone}
-> Maybe add filter to employees (by role) to select com & tech easily


Ideas1:
privilleges: Don't allow a task of type X to be created only from process link.
-> tasks types list is set dynamiclly depending on the incoming link params (paramExample: enableInstallation = true will add dynamiclly a task type = 'Installation' to tasks types list)
-> User will not be able to create a RDN if it is not the rigth time on process
-> also Responsibles field will define (when action is current) which user has the autority and permission to create RDN

-> Summary: Installation can be created only by the responsible: {admin, RT, poseur} at the rigth time (when current action = 'Créer une installation')
-> A user cannot create a certain type of tasks only if its the rigth time on process

Ideas2:
+ Maintainance & Troubleshooting:
- Add id of each item on List overview -> User can communicate easily to us the element having an issue.
- Add pull to refresh/refresh icon on forms (instead of onSnapshot).. because user has to refresh it voluntarely
